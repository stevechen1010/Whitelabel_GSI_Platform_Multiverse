      While you are a customer, we will need to retain your information to meet our legal and contractual requirements.
      However, when you cease using
      {{ companyName }}'s Services, we will still retain your personal information for a period of time. There are
      several reasons why we retain your information, these include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To comply with legal obligations under Philippine local laws (for example, anti-money laundering regulations, or
        licensing regulations);

      secured server.
    </p>

      However, we have no control and therefore cannot enforce the same amount of security on any of the devices that
      you use to access our site, or to send us information via email, messaging apps, or our website. We are therefore
      not responsible for the security and protection of information that may have been intercepted prior to our receipt
      of your personal data.
