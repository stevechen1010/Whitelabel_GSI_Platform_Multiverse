      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Money laundering is defined as the process intended to mask benefits derived from serious criminal offenses or
          criminal conduct, as described under Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001 REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9160, to make it
          appear that such benefits originated from a legitimate source. Generally, money laundering is composed of
          three (3) stages involving several transactions which could alert an intermediary such as the Company to the
          money laundering activity:
        </p>
        <p>Placement – the physical act of disposing of the cash proceeds drawn from illegal activities</p>
        <p>
          Layering – the act of separating illicit proceeds from their source by creating complex tiers of financial
          transactions in order to disguise the audit trail and provide anonymity
        </p>
        <p>
          Integration – the act of providing an appearance of legitimacy to criminally- derived wealth. If the layering
          process is successful, the integration step places the laundered proceeds back into the economy in a manner
          that their re-entry into the financial system has the appearance of being normal business funds
